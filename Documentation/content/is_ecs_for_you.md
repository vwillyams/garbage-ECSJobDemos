# Is ECS for you?

If you're considering Unity's entity-component-system (ECS), you probably fall into one of two camps:

## You already have a game, but it's slow

You've heard about the massive performance boosts you can get from using ECS and the C# job system, and you're wondering if they apply to your game. Improving performance always starts with profiling to find the slowest parts of your game. If there are __Update()__ calls taking a lot of time in the profiler, then these are probably good candidates for optimization using ECS. If your game spends most of its time in physics or rendering, then you should consider reducing those costs separately first. 

## You want to try ECS in your new game

You've heard that ECS not only improves performance, but helps you write cleaner, clearer, and more maintainable code. You'd like to see how it works for you in practice.
This is a fun scenario, because you get to write straightforward code from the beginning. There are a few things to keep in mind:

### You will probably want to use hybrid ECS at first

Right now, most of Unity's existing systems are still only designed to be used with __GameObjects__. This means that making a "pure" ECS game requires that you write a lot of what you need yourself. To get started, it is often useful to have Unity's built-in physics, audio and rendering systems. To do this, you will need GameObjects with __Colliders__, Rigidbody components, and (crucially) __GameObjectEntity__ scripts.
The important thing to remember is that this is totally fine, and Unity ECS was designed to work with traditional GameObject/component setups, as well as lightweight __Entity__/__ComponentData__ ones. You won't be able to use the job system with traditional GameObject stuff, but you'll probably find there are lots of places where you are using just Entities anyway.
