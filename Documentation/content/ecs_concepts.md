# ECS Concepts
If you are familiar with [Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) concepts, you might see the potential for naming conflicts with Unity's existing __GameObject__/__Component__ setup. Below is a list comparing how ECS concepts map to Unity's implementation:

### Entity → Entity
Unity did not have an __Entity__ to begin with, so the structure is simply named after the concept. Entities are like super lightweight GameObjects, in that they don't do much on their own, and they don't store any data (not even a name!).

You can add Components to Entities; similar to how you add Components to GameObjects.

### Component → ComponentData
We are introducing a new high-performance Component type. 

```
struct MyComponent: IComponentData
{} 
```

The __EntityManager__ manages the memory and makes hard guarantees about linear memory access when iterating over a set of Components. It also has zero overhead on a per Entity basis beyond the size of the struct itself.

In order to differentiate it from the existing Component types (such as __MonoBehaviours__), the name refers directly to the fact that it only stores data. __ComponentData__ can be added and removed from Entities.

### System → ComponentSystem
There are a lot of "systems" in Unity, so the name includes the umbrella term, "Component" as well. __ComponentSystems__ define your game's behavior, and can operate on several types of data: traditional GameObjects and Components, or pure ECS ComponentData and Entity structs.
